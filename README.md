=================
This is a ready-to-download project for Zynq-ZC70x series.
In the onetswitch directory, there is our user-designed ZC706-like board.
In the zc706 directpory, there is a demo project with one PL Ethernet PHY and its driver.
In the tools directory, there are tools for building the kernel and devicetree.

You should pay attention to the version of linux kernel and uboot. We use uboot 14.6 from Xilinx's official github.
