=================
This is a ready-to-download project for Zynq-ZC70x series.  
In the onetswitch directory, you can find a ZC706-like board related material.  
In the zc706 directpory, you can find a demo project with one PL Ethernet PHY and its driver.  
In the tools directory, there are tools for building the kernel and devicetree (compiled under x86).  

You should pay attention to the version of linux kernel and uboot. We use uboot 14.6 from Xilinx's official github.  
And linux-3.6-v14.6 in correspondence.
